# Real evaluation workflow

This workflow separates expensive model execution from inexpensive routing-policy experiments. It is designed for a constrained local machine while preserving traceability.

## 1. Materialize pinned datasets

Dataset specifications under `configs/datasets/` pin the Hugging Face source revision, split, license, homepage, adapter, and prompt version. Materialization writes benchmark JSONL plus a sibling manifest containing the record count and SHA-256 digest. HotpotQA also writes per-example retrieval documents and a deterministic corpus digest.

```bash
python -m budgetroute materialize-dataset --spec configs/datasets/gsm8k.yaml --output data/materialized/gsm8k-test.jsonl --limit 100
python -m budgetroute materialize-dataset --spec configs/datasets/mmlu.yaml --output data/materialized/mmlu-test.jsonl --limit 100
python -m budgetroute materialize-dataset --spec configs/datasets/hotpotqa.yaml --output data/materialized/hotpotqa-validation.jsonl --limit 100 --corpus-dir data/corpora/hotpotqa-validation
```

`inspect-data --manifest ...` rehashes the JSONL and rejects modified or mismatched data. Downloads and materialized files are intentionally ignored by Git.

## 2. Collect model baselines once

Model profiles pin model/tokenizer revisions, license identifiers, model-card URLs, precision, seed, and generation settings. `collect-baselines` forces live execution and fills the content-addressed generation cache. The cache key includes every request field that can influence generation plus the backend/model/generation fingerprint; request IDs are excluded so repeated policy runs reuse identical work.

```bash
python -m budgetroute collect-baselines --config configs/benchmarks/real-gsm8k.yaml
```

When retrieval is enabled, collection also runs retrieval-first and cascade paths so contextual small-model generations are available for replay.

## 3. Replay policies without models

```bash
python -m budgetroute replay-benchmark --config configs/benchmarks/real-gsm8k.yaml
```

Read-only replay does not initialize generation model weights. A cache miss is an error naming the missing backend/key rather than silently generating. Replay predictions preserve recorded generation latency, token usage, confidence, and model memory while recording replay overhead separately. Reports identify replay explicitly.

Use `verify-replay` on a small sample after backend, prompt, cache-schema, or Transformers changes:

```bash
python -m budgetroute verify-replay --config configs/benchmarks/real-gsm8k.yaml --sample-size 3
```

The verifier refreshes live entries, replays them without model initialization, and compares answer, route, execution, usage, raw confidence, uncertainty signals, and fake/real identity exactly.

## 4. Train and calibrate the router

```bash
python -m budgetroute train-router --artifacts outputs/RUN --output outputs/router/router.joblib --quality-threshold 0.8 --target-selective-accuracy 0.8
python -m budgetroute calibrate-confidence --artifacts outputs/RUN --output outputs/router/small-confidence.json --policy always_small --quality-threshold 0.8 --target-selective-accuracy 0.8
python -m budgetroute evaluate-router --router outputs/router/router.joblib --artifacts outputs/RUN --quality-threshold 0.8
```

The router uses three deterministic group-aware partitions:

- training fits feature scaling and the base classifier;
- calibration fits scalar temperature and selects the maximum-coverage threshold meeting the configured selective-accuracy target;
- test is untouched until final evaluation.

The artifact records every split ID/group, class counts, source hash, package versions, calibration parameters, selected threshold, raw/calibrated metrics, and any small-sample fallback. Groups must be disjoint whenever enough groups exist. The serving policy loads the stored calibrator and threshold unless configuration explicitly overrides the threshold.

The backend-confidence artifact can be attached with `routing.cascade_calibrator_path`. It transforms raw small-model token likelihood before cascade thresholding. Raw and calibrated values remain separate in predictions.

## Interpretation

Length-normalized token likelihood and entropy are genuine model measurements, but neither is automatically a correctness probability. Calibration is task/model/prompt specific. Cache replay supports policy comparisons over fixed model outcomes; it does not reproduce queueing, concurrent contention, thermal drift, or live batching behavior. Confirm final systems conclusions with live runs.

## 5. Train retrieval benefit separately

Paired `always_small` and `retrieval_first` rows from the same compatible run can train the retrieval-benefit artifact:

```bash
python -m budgetroute train-retrieval-router --artifacts outputs/RUN --output outputs/router/retrieval.joblib
```

Its label is the retrieval-minus-baseline quality delta, not small-model correctness. Inspect paired coverage, group partitions, calibration warning, threshold, and untouched test metrics. Validate again after changing the corpus, chunker, embedding revision, model, or prompt template.

## 6. Validate delayed-label adaptation

In a service deployment, predictions and later correctness feedback join in the operational store. `adapt-confidence` requires the configured minimum count, uses a chronological tail holdout, compares the candidate with the active calibrator, and writes an immutable candidate whether or not it is promoted.

```bash
python -m budgetroute adapt-confidence --config configs/serving/distributed.yaml
python -m budgetroute rollback-calibration --config configs/serving/distributed.yaml
```

Review candidate Brier/ECE, promotion gates, source hash, label window, and Page-Hinkley change points. A passed gate justifies a controlled deployment test, not automatic global rollout.

## Batch, concurrency, and runtime matrix

After single-request live/replay agreement is established, create separate resolved configs for each batch size, concurrency, precision, quantization, compiler state, and runtime. Do not change several dimensions inside one unlabeled run. Use enough live requests for stable tail percentiles, retain warm-up/first-compile metadata, and compare only matching model revision, prompt template, dataset, hardware, queue deadlines, and cost-unit definitions.

Cache replay can compare policy quality/cost composition but cannot measure dynamic batching, load-aware routes, model-server contention, queueing, or thermals. Those require live artifacts. The bundled local OpenAI-compatible profile is an integration example, not a compatibility or speed claim for every vLLM, llama.cpp, or Ollama release.

Use `compatibility-matrix` for exact runtime revisions, then `load-test` against authorized deployed endpoints for wall throughput and tail latency. Preserve each artifact and re-test the tool's heuristic replica suggestion rather than treating it as an autoscaling decision.
