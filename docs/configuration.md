# Configuration

Runtime behavior is defined by strict Pydantic models loaded from YAML. `extends` accepts one path or an ordered list; mappings are deep-merged left to right and the current file wins. Missing files, cycles, unknown fields, invalid types, and unsafe combinations fail with actionable errors.

## Main sections

- `models`: fake, Transformers, or OpenAI-compatible backend profiles. Real model/tokenizer revisions can be required and are recorded.
- `retrieval`: corpus/index paths, fake or Transformers embedder, exact/FAISS/HNSW index, exact embedding revision, chunking, score threshold, and HNSW graph/search parameters.
- `routing`: policy, difficulty/cascade/retrieval thresholds, learned artifacts, load/cost weights, and review behavior.
- `batching`: local queue size, maximum batch, first-item wait, admission timeout, and end-to-end deadline.
- `api`: bind address, trusted hosts, request limits, authentication sources, review/feedback switches, and built-in or external TLS boundary.
- `operations`: memory/SQLite backend, database path, replica ID source, shared quota, global inflight leases, and audit retention.
- `adaptation`: delayed-label registry, minimum sample count, chronological holdout, Brier/ECE gates, selective target, and Page-Hinkley settings.
- `content_policy`: optional literal input/output rules plus always-enforced metadata byte/depth/key bounds.
- `monitoring`: bounded window, baseline size/file, and drift threshold.
- `benchmark`: dataset, policies, warm-up/measured runs, concurrency/batch size, cache, bootstrap resamples, and minimum sample count for claims.

## Safety validation

Configuration rejects, among other cases:

- fake/real backend mismatches, missing model IDs, unpinned revisions when pinning is required, and invalid device/precision/quantization combinations;
- credential-bearing or malformed model-server URLs; remote servers require explicit opt-in and HTTPS;
- learned policies without artifacts and retrieval policies without retrieval;
- invalid chunk/HNSW settings and Transformers embeddings without model ID and exact revision;
- non-loopback API binding without an API credential source and either a certificate/key pair or `external_tls_termination: true`;
- partial TLS configuration, missing certificate/key files, missing environment credentials at runtime, and unavailable optional dependencies.

`external_tls_termination` is an operator assertion, not automatic TLS discovery. It is appropriate only when a trusted proxy/load balancer terminates HTTPS and the application port is network-restricted.

## Credential formats

Legacy single-key mode names `api.api_key_env`, normally `BUDGETROUTE_API_KEY`. Tenant mode names `api.tenant_keys_env`, normally `BUDGETROUTE_TENANT_KEYS_JSON`. The JSON value has this schema:

```json
{
  "tenants": [
    {
      "tenant_id": "acme",
      "subject": "reviewer-1",
      "api_key": "a long random secret",
      "scopes": ["inference", "feedback", "review"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Tenant and subject identifiers are bounded strings. Keys and subject/key pairs must be unique; multiple subjects may belong to one tenant. `admin` implies all scopes. Tenant mode is exclusive: when `tenant_keys_env` is configured, an inherited legacy-key variable is not accepted as a global bypass. Credential values are loaded at process construction and compared in constant time. Rotate by changing the secret source and restarting replicas; support overlapping old/new subjects when a no-downtime rotation is needed.

## Environment overrides

```text
BUDGETROUTE_OUTPUT_DIR
BUDGETROUTE_HOST
BUDGETROUTE_PORT
BUDGETROUTE_LOG_LEVEL
BUDGETROUTE_API_KEY
BUDGETROUTE_TENANT_KEYS_JSON
BUDGETROUTE_REPLICA_ID
```

The first four are direct overrides. The remaining variables are read only when named by the selected config. The project does not implicitly load `.env`; use a shell, secret manager, container runtime, or orchestrator. Sanitized config responses expose credential source names and TLS state, never secret values or arbitrary environment contents.

## Recommended profiles

- `configs/serving/fake.yaml`: local no-network development.
- `configs/serving/secure.yaml`: authenticated service behind explicit external TLS termination.
- `configs/serving/distributed.yaml`: tenant scopes, SQLite coordination, durable feedback/review/audit, adaptation registry, and content rules.
- `configs/retrieval/semantic-hnsw.yaml`: revision-pinned semantic embedding and HNSW fragment; compose it into a serving/benchmark profile.
- `configs/routing/learned-retrieval.yaml`: learned retrieval-benefit fragment; set its trained artifact path.
- `configs/benchmarks/real-gpu-mmlu-500-live.yaml`: paired small/large outcome collection for router development.
- `configs/benchmarks/real-gpu-mmlu-500-learned-live.yaml`: live learned/cascade comparison restricted to the persisted router test split.
- `configs/benchmarks/real-gpu-mmlu-500-learned-replay.yaml`: model-free replay of that held-out comparison from a complete cache.

Leaving `routing.retrieval_benefit_threshold` unset uses the calibration-selected value stored in the artifact; set it only as an explicit reviewed override.

Run both `validate-config` and `security-check` against the exact deployment config and environment before serving.
